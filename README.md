# React Frontend Task

This project is a simple HTML page with React.js integration. The goal is to create a table where each column is editable, and the edited data is ready to be posted to an API (database). The project initially used React, but due to an error, it was implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

## This error that occured when I implemented the react cdn links:

I tried several ways to resolve it, but it couldn't. So, I created a separate branch and did the task 1 here in the branch: /task-1-react

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the React component and necessary scripts.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the table.
- `script.js`: The original JavaScript file using React.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## To check the React implementation of this project switch the branch: /task-1-react
