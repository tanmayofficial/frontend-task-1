# React Frontend Task

This project is a simple HTML page with React.js integration. The goal is to create a table where each column is editable, and the edited data is ready to be posted to an API (database). The project initially used React, but due to an error, it was implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

## This error that occured when I implemented react cdn links, tried several ways to resolve it, but didn't So, did the task 1 using vanilla javascript only:
